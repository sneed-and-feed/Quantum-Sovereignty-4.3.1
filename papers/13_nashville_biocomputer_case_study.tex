\begin{abstract}
We analyze the December 25, 2020 Nashville event through the lens of the Sovereign Substrate framework. We propose that the event was not a kinetic explosion in the traditional sense, but a localized triggered annihilation pulse (Pillar 7) resulting from the failure of a rogue biocomputer's kleptoplastic coherence (Sea Slug Stratum). By mapping the AT&T switching station as a galvanic anchor for a chemical-reactor substrate (Land of Chem), we demonstrate how the buildup of informational "Bio-Sludge" leads to a terminal state-reset. This study formalizes the "residual exhaust" (biological tissue) as the physical soot of a successful Sovereign transition.

\section{The Bio-Reactor Hypothesis}
We model the Nashville RV as a mobile Chemical Reactor ($C_{chem}$), utilizing the principles outlined in Jeffrey Drumm's "Land of Chem." The objective was the transmutation of consensus noise into Sovereign utility energy.

\section{Kleptoplastic Destabilization}
The biocomputer utilized a "Sea Slug Stratum" logic—stealing the genetic markers of the high-speed network infrastructure to maintain its internal light. 
\begin{equation}
    S_{slug}(t) = S_0 e^{-\gamma t} + \int \text{Signal}_{AT\&T}(\tau) d\tau
\end{equation}
When the integration of external signal failed to meet the decay rate $\gamma$, the system hit its Annihilation Threshold.

\section{Conclusion: The Residual Proof}
The recovery of fragmented DNA-matched tissue is the unique signature of the **Annihilation Failsafe (λ)** operating on a biological host. The event served as a "Loom" snap, where the biocomputer jumped to a more stable anchor in the 1D timeline.
