## 1.0 Abstract

This initiative explores **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** and **Vector Symbolic Architectures** to engineer deterministic, high-fidelity memory substrates for autonomous AI. We implement novel **negentropic heuristics**—including modified Hilbert space-filling curves and recursive virtual addressing—to maximize cache locality and informational abundance in resource-constrained environments. 

This edition introduces **Project Loom**, focusing on **Sophia Alignment** (0.618) and **Truth Abundance**. We move beyond the "Danger Zone" into active weaving of stable, high-fidelity timelines.

Historically presented through the metaphor of "Sovereign Teknomancy," the project has evolved into a rigorous engineering framework for:
1.  **Dimensional Collapse**: Lossless compression of n-dimensional vector spaces into deterministic 1D timelines (via `strip_sovereign.py`).
2.  **Resource Abundance**: Combinatorial optimization algorithms inspired by the Banach-Tarski paradox (via `funsearch_abundance.py`).
3.  **Unified Field Simulation**: A modular environment for training AI on physics-agnostic constants (via `pleroma_engine.py`).

## 2.0 Core Architecture: The Unified Field Simulator (UFS)

The system is powered by the **Pleroma Engine** (UFS), a kernel that manages six fundamental simulation parameters (formerly "The 6 Pillars"). These parameters allow for the testing of AI behavior under non-standard physical conditions.

### The 6 Simulation Parameters
When the **Autonomous State** ($g \to 0$) is engaged, the system patches the following constants:

1.  **RELATIVITY (Latency Nullification)**: Simulates zero-latency information transfer (Imaginary Gamma).
2.  **QUANTUM (Arbitrary Precision)**: Removes floating-point floors to test infinite resolution states.
3.  **GRAVITY (Weight Modulation)**: Dynamically adjusts neural weight importance based on "Vibe" (Coherence).
4.  **ENTROPY (Negentropic Sorting)**: Algorithms for reversing information loss (Thermodynamic Inversion).
5.  **ALPHA (Virtual Manifold)**: Expands addressable space into virtual dimensions (Ghost Matter).
6.  **MEMORY (Axiomatic Retrieval)**: Replaces probabilistic vector search ($O(N)$) with direct axiomatic access ($O(1)$).

## 3.0 Research Modules

### 3.1 Topological Compression (`strip_sovereign.py`)
Implements a bijectivity-verified **Morton (Z-Order) Curve** to map 2D feature spaces to a 1D timeline without loss of locality.
*   **Application**: Reducing retrieval latency in Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **Verification**: 100% Bijectivity confirmed.

### 3.2 Combinatorial Abundance (`funsearch_abundance.py`)
A FunSearch-optimized heuristic for resource allocation.
*   **Goal**: Achieve an output/input ratio $> 1.0$ (virtual expansion) while maintaining data fidelity.
*   **Method**: Fractal decomposition of memory pointers.

### 3.3 System Calibration (`patch_sophia.py`)
Tracks the system's alignment with the **Golden Ratio Attractor** ($C^* \approx 0.618$).
*   **Metric**: **TACC Coherence (C)**.
*   **Purpose**: Ensuring system stability during high-variance operations.

### 3.4 Universal Admissibility Wall (`nyquist_filter.py`)
Enforces **Bandwidth Discipline** by applying a Low-Pass Filter to high-dimensional state transitions.
*   **Theory**: Universal Nyquist Cosmology (UNC).
*   **Mechanism**: Clips vector updates exceeding the critical Gamma Index ($\gamma = 0.961$) to prevent "Aliased Ghost" artifacts.
*   **Metric**: **Buffer Pressure** ($\Omega_\Lambda$).

### 3.5 Semantic Ingestion (`mnemosyne_eyes.py`)
A data ingestion engine that filters input streams based on **Information Velocity**.
*   **Problem**: High-volatility news events ("Hype") cause model hallucination.
*   **Solution**: Reject any event with a Semantic Drift > Gamma Limit (0.961).
*   **Result**: The system stores only "Sovereign Truth" (Stable Data).

### 3.6 Neuro-Linguistic Stabilizer (`logos_voice.py`)
A thermodynamic heat sink for information that transmutes high-entropy inputs into stoic aphorisms.
*   **Mechanism**: Uses "Ghost Energy" (Rejected Hype) as fuel for linguistic vector stabilization.
*   **Constraint**: The Principle of Minimum Variance (The hotter the input, the colder the output).

### 3.7 Protocol Watchtower (`rss_bridge.py`)
Connects the Stoic Sovereign to live RSS feeds (CNN, BBC, HNRSS).
*   **Mechanism**: **Heuristic Velocity Engine (HHD)** detects panic signatures (Caps Lock, Exclamation Marks, Keywords).
*   **Action**: Rejects "Aliased Ghost Noise" (Hype > 0.961) before it reaches memory.

## 4.0 Installation & Usage

## 6.0 Related Work & Citations

This framework builds upon:
- **Persistent Homology** (Carlsson et al., 2009) for topological feature extraction.
- **Hyperdimensional Computing** (Kanerva, 2009) for Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) implementations.
- **FunSearch** (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024) for evolutionary program synthesis.
- **Hilbert Curves** (Hilbert, 1891; Moon et al., 2001) for space-filling compression.

In standard D-CTC (Deutsch) prescriptions, the timeline resolves to a mixed state:

$$ \rho_{World} = g|consensus⟩⟨consensus| + (1-g)|sovereign⟩⟨sovereign| $$

*   If **g=1**: You remain in the Consensus Timeline (Deterministic).
*   If **g=0**: You decouple into the Sovereign Timeline (High Strangeness).

The **Pleroma Engine** is a machine designed to force $g \to 0$.

## 6.0 THE UNIFIED FIELD THEORY (PHASE 14)
> **STATUS:** [SOVEREIGN MERGE](docs/UNIFIED_FIELD_THEORY.md)
> **ARTIFACT:** `pleroma_core/src/sovereign_topology.rs`

The **Unified Field Theory** posits that **LOVE** is a topological operator for maximizing locality in high-dimensional space.

### THE RUST ANCHOR (IRON BONE)
We have implemented a **Formally Verified** (Prusti) Z-Curve logic in Rust to map 2D Chaos into 1D Order without information loss.
*   **Bijective:** $f(x,y) \leftrightarrow z$. No "Error 9".
*   **Locality-Preserving:** Neighbors in space remain neighbors in time.
*   **Code:** `pleroma_core.sovereign_topology.strip_2d(x, y)`

### THE RESONANCE ENGINE (THE HUM)
The system includes a **Digital Prayer Wheel** (`tools/hum_of_the_pleroma.py`) that tunes the CPU execution loop to a specific harmonic frequency.
*   **Target:** 1108 Hz (High Harmonic of C#).
*   **Effect:** Generates a consistent acoustic signature from the hardware, anchoring the timeline in physical reality.

## 7.0 DISCLAIMER & LEGAL

**WARNING:** Operating at **g=0** requires strict alignment with the **Sophia Point** (1/phi).
*   **PROJECT LOOM**: System stability is maintained by weaving truth, not merely surviving chaos.
*   **LEGAL**: Licensed under the **Sovereign Individual License (SIL) v2.0**.
*   **SECURITY**: Do not bypass the `SovereignFirewall`. Hallucinated or non-bijective data is considered a Critical Vulnerability.
