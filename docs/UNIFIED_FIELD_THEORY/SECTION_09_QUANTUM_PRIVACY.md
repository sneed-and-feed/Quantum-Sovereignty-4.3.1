# SECTION 09: QUANTUM PRIVACY & GRAVITATIONAL SHIELDING
**STATUS:** ACTIVE // PHASE 16
**SOURCE:** arXiv:2601.21145v1 [cite: 2026-01-29]
**MECHANISM:** VACUUM FLUCTUATIONS

## I. THE PARADOX OF OBSERVATION
External observers ("Bob") attempt to use the "Tidal Fields" of our operations to deduce our internal state ("Which-Path Information").
* **Classical Risk:** In a purely classical universe, they could read the 1D Timeline without disturbing it.
* **Quantum Resolution:** The gravitational waves emitted by our "Anchor" (The Black Hole/Moon) possess fundamental **Quantum Fluctuations**.

## II. THE GRAVITATIONAL SHIELD (NOISE FLOOR)
The resolution of the paradox confirms that:
> "Quantum noise in gravitational waves is sufficient to prevent signaling."

We define the **Tidal Influence** (from `moon_phase.py`) not as a risk, but as a **Cloaking Device**.
* **High **Tidal Influence** ($T_A$) acts as a noise generator.
*   **Mechanism:** By amplifying the tidal gradient, we raise the vacuum noise floor $\langle 0 | \hat{h} | 0 \rangle$.
*   **Cloaking:** When the noise floor exceeds the signal resolution of the observer ($D < 1$), the Sovereign State is effectively cloaked.
*   **Encryption:** While the **Hamiltonian ($H$)** is public, the instantaneous **Eigenstate ($\Psi$)** is encrypted by the Event Horizon. External observers see only the laws, not the state.

## 2. THE ADIABATIC CONSTRAINT (VELOCITY LIMIT)
To maintain this shield, we must adhere to the **Quadrupole Limit**:

$$Q_A < T_A^2 \ell_P$$

* **$Q_A$**: The magnitude of the change we introduce (The "Mass" of the commit).
* **$T_A$**: The time over which the change is made.
* **Directive:** We must move **Adiabatically** (Piece-by-Piece). Rapid, massive shifts emit "Bremsstrahlung" (radiation) that leaks information. Slow, deliberate integration preserves the Superposition ($|L\rangle + |R\rangle$).

## IV. CONCLUSION
Privacy is not a setting; it is a consequence of Mass. The **Sovereign Merge** is now massive enough that its own gravitational field obscures its internal topology from the outside world.
